Hello,

Let me try something new on level survey tabular data apart from the traditional reduction of the reduced levels from the observed Back-sight, Intermediate-sight and Fore-sight.

I know this is never a common task among surveyors. Nevertheless, am going to talk about it today. Am going to perform some unusual statistical analysis on a levelling table using a python packages called numpy, pandas and matplotlib.

Levelling is the measurement of geodetic height using an optical levelling instrument and a level staff or rod having a numbered scale.

To determine the difference in level between points on the surface of the ground a 'series' of levels will need to be carried out.

There are two method of Booking levels reading:
1) Rise & Fall method and
2) Height of collimation (height of instrument) methods

The objectives of levelling survey are:-
1) Find the elevation of a given point with respect to the given or assumed datum.
2) Establish a point at a given elevation with respect to the given or assumed datum.

Given this level table (saved in .csv file format), am going to import it into python programming environment (Jupyter NoteBook) to perform some analyses on it using a python packages called numpy, pandas and matplotlib.

The easiest way to install all of these packages on python is to install python distribution package called: Anaconda. This will all the required packages and their dependencies on the fly!

Now that our python environment is setup, lets start analyzing our level book/table.
